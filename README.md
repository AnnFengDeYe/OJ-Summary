## 💡 Design Philosophy

The Tao of C++ lies not in accumulation, but in integration.

Faced with the vast ocean of C++ syntax, fragmented learning often leads one astray. This is especially true in the era of ubiquitous AI-assisted programming, where rote memorization of syntax no longer builds a competitive moat.

This series is dedicated to a deep synthesis of the C/C++ core, rejecting any artificial separation of the two or immersion in the superficial allure of Modern C++ syntax.

This repository aims to assist learners in constructing a robust mental framework. With this foundation, obscure syntactic details cease to be items for rote memorization; instead, they become logical necessities, sprouting naturally like leaves from a solid trunk.

**Key Features:**
- **Simplified Physical World Models**: All code examples are carefully designed to avoid overwhelming syntax details, using minimalist real-world analogies instead
- **Intuitive Analogies** (examples): 
  - In the Smart Pointers tutorial, we use "private car" to represent `unique_ptr` (exclusive ownership) and "bus" for `shared_ptr` (shared ownership)
  - In the Move Semantics tutorial, we use direct "relocation" of image pixels to illustrate efficient memory movement, rather than traditional copy operations
  - More creative analogies await in the videos
  
Through these simple physical scenarios, we aim to help more people grasp the most essential and fundamental design philosophy of C++.
